# 1. Modify your "interface" in such a way that the legitimacy of the user's move is checked,
# and the move is only made if it is legitimate. (1)Read a player's color ("R" or "B"),
# (2) a starting point and (3) a number between 1 and 6 (a roll), and the move is made if it can be.

# 2. Write a program that prints a given board in a very simple way (one line with points
# 11 to 0, and another line with points 12 to 23). Each point must be printed as "0"
# (no checkers) or "nR" or "nB" for `n` red or `n` black checkers.
