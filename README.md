# intro-to-programming
#The aim of this course is to develop the skills necessary for solving simple programming tasks and for knowing where to look
#when addressing more complex tasks.  The programming language used will be Python, but the overall aim is to understand basic
#programming concepts to such an extent that the acquired skills can be extended to other languages relatively easily.
#We will approach programming in the spirit of Niklaus Wirth, who invented the slogan “Programming = algorithms plus data
#structures”.  We will think of programs as tools for creating a virtual world (in the form of data structures) and performing
#operations in that world (using algorithms).  Furthermore, we follow Donald Knuth's principle, who emphasized that programs
#are written for people rather than machines, therefore the main virtues of a program are readability and modularity.
#Since we will view programming as more of a practical skill than a theoretical issue, we will proceed in circles: the
#essentials of data structures and algorithms, then progressively more details of data and more details of programs and
#program structure.
